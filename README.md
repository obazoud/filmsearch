==========

It's a sunny afternoon in San Francisco, and I'm having an espresso at Larkin
and California, watching the cable cars run past and thinking of web projects
of interest.

I think I'll attempt to:

- [x] Download and import the latest copy of the IMDB database into Postgres
- [x] Write up a document schema to support interesting searches over films
- [x] Spin up an ElasticSearch cluster to hold the content
- [x] Write some SQL and indexing code to import the documents
- [ ] Find/build a faceted search interface to navigate the films

Some ideas for features / things I'd like to see, some easy, some hard:

- Searching for films by country
- Searching for films based on actor/actress, director, etc
- Creation of personal 'favourites' lists / starred films
- Pull in screening times - ideally cinema and TV
- Pull in relevant news content alongside
- Some kind of social media integration
